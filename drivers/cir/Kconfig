	bool "CIR (infrared) receiver"
	help
		Listen for input from an infrared remote controller or
		keyboard. This can be used as a wakeup source.

config CIR_WAKE_CODE
	hex "Scan code for wakeup"
	range 0x1 0xffffffff
	default 0x800f040c
	help
		Choose the scan code that will wake the system when detected.

		The default value will work with an RC6 MCE remote controller.

config CIR_CLK_RATE
	int
	default 125000 if CIR_USE_OSC24M # 24 MHz divided by 192
	default 32768
	help
		Provide the sample frequency used for protocol decoding.

config CIR_USE_OSC24M
	bool "Use OSC24M as parent clock"
	help
		Sometimes boards come without external 32768 Hz oscillator
		and thus RTC use the internal RC oscilator as a source
		for generating 32768 Hz clock. However, such clock is
		not precise enough for IR signal decoding purposes.

		Set this option to Y if your board doesn't have external
		32768 Hz oscillator. Note that this increases power
		consumption.

config R_CIR_RX_PIN
	int
	default  9 if PLATFORM_H6
	default 11 if PLATFORM_A64 || PLATFORM_H3
	default 12 if PLATFORM_A83T
	help
		Provide the Port L pin number used by the CIR receiver.
