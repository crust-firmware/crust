		Sometimes boards come without external 32768 Hz oscillator and
		thus RTC use internal RC oscilator as a source for generating
		32768 Hz clock. However, such clock is not precise enough for
		RC6 IR signal decoding purposes.

		Set this option to y if your board doesn't have external 32768
		Hz oscillator. Note that this increases power consumption.
