menu "Debugging options"

config ASSERT
	bool "Enable runtime assertion checking"
	default y
	help
		Enable assert() logic to validate assumptions and find
		bugs at runtime. If in doubt, say Y.

config ASSERT_VERBOSE
	bool "Verbose logging of assertion failures"
	depends on ASSERT
	help
		When an assertion fails, print detailed information
		about it to the console. This includes the expression
		that was checked, as well as the file and line number of
		the call to assert().

		The address of the failed assertion is printed with or
		without this option. Since all of the other details can
		be derived from the address and debug info (see below),
		enabling this option is only necessary when debug info
		is unavailable.

		Note that this option significantly increases the size
		of the final firmware binary. If in doubt, say N.

config COMPILE_TEST
	bool "Allow compiling a firmware that does not run"
	help
		Some combinations of options may not make sense or may
		not produce a functional firmware, for example if the
		firmware becomes too large, or if it contains multiple
		drivers for the same piece of hardware.

		This is mostly useful for development and automated
		testing. Users should say N.

config DEBUG_INFO
	bool "Compile the firmware with debug info"
	default y
	help
		When compiling the firmware, generate debug information
		for use with gdb. These are stripped out of the final
		firmware binary, so this option does not affect the
		loaded firmware size. If in doubt, say Y.

config DEBUG_LOG
	bool "Print additional debug-level log messages"
	help
		This enables the debug() logging macro to print verbose
		informational messages that may aid in debugging.

config DEBUG_MONITOR
	bool "Provide an interactive debug monitor while off/asleep"
	help
		While the system is off or asleep, accept simple commands
		on the serial port. Parsing is extremely basic, and line
		editing is not supported. Available commands are:
			m <address> [value] -- read/write memory
			w -- trigger wakeup

		With a PMIC present, additional commands are supported:
			p <address> [value] -- read/write PMIC registers

config DEBUG_MONITOR_PMIC
	bool
	depends on DEBUG_MONITOR
	default MFD_AXP20X

config DEBUG_PRINT_BATTERY
	bool "Print battery consumption periodically while off/asleep"
	depends on MFD_AXP223 || MFD_AXP803
	help
		While the system is off or asleep and the battery is
		discharging, print the battery voltage, discharge
		current, and calculated power usage every 30 seconds.

config DEBUG_PRINT_LATENCY
	bool "Print average latency after each state transition"
	help
		After each system state transition, calculate the
		average latency of the main loop, in AR100 clock cycles.
		The latency will be printed after the firmware has
		performed 10000 iterations in that state.

config DEBUG_PRINT_SPRS
	bool "Print the contents of Special Purpose Registers at boot"
	depends on ARCH_OR1K
	help
		The OpenRISC 1000 architecture defines various Special
		Purpose Registers, or SPRs, that describe the particular
		CPU implementation. Enable this option to print a subset
		of these SPRs in a human-readable format during boot.

config DEBUG_RECORD_STEPS
	bool "Record steps of the suspend/resume process in the RTC"
	depends on !PLATFORM_A83T # No RTC
	help
		Record the start of various steps of the suspend and
		resume processes in one of the RTC's general purpose
		registers. This provides an approximation of what the
		firmware was doing at the time of a hang. The last step
		will remain available in the RTC until a clean shutdown
		or reboot, or until power is removed.

config DEBUG_VERIFY_DRAM
	bool "Verify DRAM contents after controller resume"
	help
		After reinitializing the DRAM controller during system
		resume, verify that DRAM contents were preserved via a
		simple checksum.

		The algorithm is very simplistic, and only a small
		portion of DRAM is checked, so there is no guarantee
		that corruption will be detected.
