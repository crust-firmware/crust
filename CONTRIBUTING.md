# Contribution guidelines

Thank you for expressing interest in contributing to the development and
maintenance of the Crust firmware. The success of the Crust firmware project is
made possible by community support of source code and documentation. This
document contains guidelines and procedures for contributing to the Crust
firmware project.

## Code of conduct

This project is governed by the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct][coc].
By contributing to Crust firmware, you are entering an agreement to uphold all
guidelines and responsibilities outlined within. Please carefully read and
review the agreement before contributing.

## Issue tracking

All bugs and features are tracked through the Crust firmware GitHub [issues
page][issues]. When filing issues, please follow the provided issue template to
ensure prompt and personalized support.

### Labels

Labels are used to indicate the lifecycle of all Crust firmware issues. Labels
are prefixed with letters corresponding to the chart below.

| Prefix           | Description
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------
| Area (A)         | Indicates the area of the project impacted.
| Difficulty (D)   | Indicates the expected difficulty of an issue.
| Resolution (R)   | Indicates the resolution of an issue.
| Status (S)       | Indicates the status of an issue.
| Type (T)         | Indicates the type of an issue.

Additionally, the labels "good first issue" and "help wanted" may be applied to
an issue or pull request. An issue labeled with "good first issue" is an issue
that is recommended for new contributors. An issue labeled with "help wanted"
is an issue that project maintainers request community help resolving.

## Submitting a patch

The Crust firmware project accepts patches through the use of GitHub pull
requests. Although project maintainers accept impromptu pull requests on
occasion, it is recommended that all pull requests correspond to an issue on
the Crust firmware [issues page][issues]. Pull requests submitted _without_ a
corresponding issue may be rejected. If you believe Crust firmware could
benefit from a new feature, please submit a feature request on the Crust
firmware [issues page][issues].

### Patch lifecycle

1. Comment on an issue from the Crust firmware [issues page][issues] to let
   project maintainers know you would like to work on the issue. Project
   maintainers will either acknowledge your comment or suggest another issue
   if the issue is already being addressed.
2. Submit a work-in-progress pull request (WIP) to receive early feedback from
   project maintainers. Work-in-progress pull requests should be prefixed with
   `WIP:`.
3. Address feedback from project maintainers. Prompt responses will allow a
   pull request to get merged sooner!
4. Complete the process until the pull request is approved by the project
   maintainers.

### Commits

All contributions to this project must be released under the open-source
license used by the project. To help ensure this, all commits you make must be
accompanied by your real name and a `Signed-off-by` tag asserting authorship
and permission to contribute, per the [Developer Certificate of Origin][dco].
This tag can be added automatically by git using `git commit -s`.

Each change submitted in a pull request that addresses a different scope of the
project should be contained within its own commit (with the exception of global
changes, such as renaming files, that affect the entire project).

For example, a pull request submitted for a new hardware component could
include the following four commits:

1. The first commit should add the headers and source files for the generic
   driver class, if one is being added. (e.g. `drivers/<class>/<class>.c` and
   `include/drivers/<class>.h`).
2. The second commit should add the driver and its header (e.g.
   `drivers/<class>/<driver>.c` and `include/drivers/<class>/<driver>.h`).
3. The third set of commits (one for each platform) should add the devices that
   use this driver to `platform/<platform>/devices.c`. If this driver supplies
   an additional platform-specific header, that should go before these commits.
4. Finally, the device may be used from common code (e.g. in `common/main.c` or
   `common/scpi_cmds.c`).

Changes to submitted pull requests that address feedback from project
maintainers should be squashed into existing commits rather than being included
at the end of a pull request as a new commit.

### Continuous integration testing

All pull requests are built and tested with Travis CI upon submission. To
verify that your changes will pass the CI build, the following process should
be used:

- Verify source code style with `make check-format`. (This requires installing
  [Uncrustify][uncrustify]. See below.)
- Run integration tests by building the firmware with `make TEST=1` and running
  it on the hardware (if possible).

## Formatting

Crust firmware uses Uncrustify to format all source code files. Running `make
format` will format all project files according to a predefined style guide.

The following are _general_ formatting guidelines:
- Lines should be no longer than 79 characters plus the trailing newline
  character.
- Use tabs for indentation and spaces for alignment for all C source code and
  header files.
- Trim all trailing whitespace.
- Where multiple words must be combined into one, use hyphens in strings,
  filenames, and documentation; however, use underscores in function, variable
  names and header guards.

### C files

Functions in drivers should be topologically sorted (i.e. the `probe` function
belongs at the bottom). Other functions should be sorted in alphabetical order
with small, `static` helper functions at the top. Functions and macros in
headers should be alphabetically sorted whenever possible.

### Writing headers

- Header files act as APIs and are reserved for functions that will be
  _exposed_ to the rest of the project. Macros, `struct` definitions, and
  function declarations that are only utilized by a driver or module belong in
  the corresponding implementation file, rather than the header file.
- Public macros, function prototypes, and declarations should be documented
  according to [Doxygen JavaDoc-style comment blocks][doxygen].
- Functions defined in assembly should also be declared in a header, unless
  they are not intended to be called directly (e.g. `__udivsi3`).
- Ideally, the header should be named the same as the driver or source file,
  except that it should be placed inside the include hierarchy.
- The header guard should be the same as the path you would need to put in your
  `#include` directive, but with the following changes:
  - All letters should be uppercase.
  - All hyphens, slashes, and periods should be replaced by underscores.

### Naming drivers

Drivers should be named as vaguely as the hardware allows. For example, if a
driver supports the CCU on all sunxi devices, it should be named `sunxi-ccu`.
If it supports the 64-bit counter _first introduced_ with the sun6i series, it
should be named `sun6i-cnt64`. If a driver only supports the SY8106A voltage
regulator, it should be named `sy8106a`.

### Assembly

Assembly files are preprocessed, so they should use the file extension `.S`
(and this is the only extension the build system looks for). They should not
have the same path as a C file (excluding the extension), as the build system
cannot disambiguate the two.

Assembly should be formatted as follows:
- Local control-flow labels should be numbered, not named.
- Local data labels should be named descriptively.
- Global data and functions should use the `data` and `func`/`endfunc` macros
  from `macros.S`.
- Indent the instruction by one tab.
- Indent the first operand with one tab.
- Indent following operands with a single space.
- Use `#` to start comments.
- Align comments at 40 columns with tabs.
